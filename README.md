This script was created to ease the ELT process in tracking personal finances.
As opposed to creating and writing records by copying data from a banks website,
this script loads a .CSV file from a specified bank and extract the data from
each transaction, the raw data is then loaded into a transactions file.
After the data is loaded, it is then, with user input, loaded into a 
budget lines file. The loaded budget lines have normalized data and standardized
formatting to create more accurate data for analysis and practical use.
