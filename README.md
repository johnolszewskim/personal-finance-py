OBJECTIVES
1. Create a functional Python script for importing bank transaction information
2. Expand and refine Python coding skills with a special emphasis on unique functional programming capabilities
3. Get familiar with Python industry and styling standards including PEP 8

1. pf_console is a command line script that extracts, loads, and transforms data from a user's banks into a local
   CSV file. The goal of this program is to standardize imported data to be used later in budgeting and other 
   financial analysis. The program uses historical data, to make suggestions to the user about correct vendor names,
   and transaction categorization.

   I found that importing this information into an Excel document was time-consuming and I, therefore, was less likely
   to do it and would fall behind tracking my personal finance. The program is meant to make this process more
   efficient through automation and ease of use.

2. Coming from a mainly OOD background the goal was to emphasize unique functional programming capabilities. This
   was most significantly used in the PFConsole class. The PFConsole. Functions variable is a list of functions
   stored as objects. This allows the program to easily navigate through the various program tasks based on 
   user input. Familiarity with Python and comfort with libraries like Pandas was also a result.

3. Main lessons learned were the styling of Python programs and naming of variables, files, classes and methods
   to be in accordance with PEP 8 styling. Additionally, module and package organization was a valuable lesson
   learned through this project.
